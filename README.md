Thinks abouot how to introduce the main page eg by using https://material.io/guidelines/motion/material-motion.html you can have each main square coming in a material otion kind a way

Also for the mobile version the Shrine example is pretty good of the effect we are trying to achieve https://material.io/guidelines/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-what-makes-a-good-transition

Try to create a sticky note effect, think about ways to integratrpictures smoothly in the process. Like maybe try to abstract the concept of the Polaroid. Or add some filters which unveil on hover. 

Change the cards so that instead of scaling you change the zindex.

Add some color filters on the smaller pages in the -900px

Maybe have a button to refresh all the home articles. Only have the first page have the featured elements

At the end of the articles give the option to the user o react like buzzfeed/ facebook. 
Add timeout to the loader at route 38; Or maybe add a transition where all the post it pop in like mushrooms with a bit of a fade in efffect or that cool material thingie

The following images are resized in HTML or CSS. Serving scaled images could save 267.0KiB (72% reduction). Find a way to resize images server side 

Really work on the preloader

fix the scss problem in production


Build transition for home element to appear maybe the side ones first then the one in the middle because user will see the middle one first anyway. 

Thing about the best way to introduce the blogpost eg map method v 
Should store the value of fetch in a variable then propagate it. 
Think about introducing a  statemnt to catch if the result of the fetch is null

think about populating the state like this when you go from one post to the other you can simply change the states. 

should I have an other db with sluf matched with ids to find stuff more quickly in the db?
